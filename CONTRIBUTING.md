# Contributing

To be honest, I mainly need help sourcing and filling the [data.json](https://gitlab.com/zuedev/shopkeep/-/blob/master/src/data.json) with all the items, services, and treasures available in the official D&D literature.

## Process

Send me a merge request with a detailed description of what you're submitting and why. I don't need an essay, just enough to understand things.
